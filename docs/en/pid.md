# PID Adapter Information

## General information

This adapter provides one or more configurable pid controllers per instance.

The general functionality of a pid controller is documented i.e. at wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). In short a pid controller computes an output value depending on the input value and three parameters:

-   proportional component
-   integral component
-   deriative component

This ioBroker adapter allows the configuration of the pid controller by specifying several parameters listed [here](#controller-configuration) . The output value is calculated in regular intervalls specified as cylce time. In addition the calulation can be suspended and internal values can be reset on demand.

As an convinient feature the output value can be set to a specified value when operating in manual mode.

States used for input and set by controller output are listed in section [Description of States](#description-of-states)

## Configuration

### TAB Configuration

This tab allows to specifiy one or more controller instances operanting independently.

#### Configurationmode Selection

You may speciify the following parameters:

- configuration mode <br>
  The field `configuration mode`allows to select whether Kp/Tn/Tv mode or Xp/tn/Tv mode is desired. Right to the selection you will see the formula used for calculation depending on the seletcion.

- ignore setpoint for derivate <br>
  If this field is selected the difference value for the derivative term is calculated based on the actual value only, otherwise the setpoint value is taken into account too.

#### Controller Configuration

This table allows to configure a list of controllers

### TAB General Options

Here you specify some general options

<p align=center><img src="img/pid_tab_options.jpg" width="600" /></p>

-   log calculation <br>
    Setting this option activates logging of data calculated during regular recomputaions.

-   disable folders for states <br>
    Normally states are structured using folders. If a flat structure is prefered activating this option disables all folders. Please note that changing this option will delete all existing states. This might have sideeffects i.e. related to history recording. Thus a warning must be confirmed before this option can be changed. 

## Details of Functionality

### Description of States

Every adapter instance creates a set of states per configured controller. The following table describes the contents of those states and wether they are read-only (RO) or writeable by users (RW).

### Hysteresis Handling and Update of Output

The adapter evaluates every input written to state 'act' and calclutaes the difference to 'set'. If the difference is smaller than the hysteresis value no recalculation is performed. This reduces small changes to output if 'act' only changes a little bit.

If the adapter control state 'hold' is set to true, no new calculation is performed. The output is frozen ('on-hold') while 'hold' is set to true.

If a non zero cycle time is configured (and 'hold' is false) the adapter performs a recalculation every x ms specified by 'cycle'. The result of the calulation is written to the appropiate states. You can check the internal values too.
